### Reminders

- Use `broadcast` and `persist` to better manage memory usage.
- Check on notes for other approaches
- Raw RDDs?

### Questions

- Patents:
	- do patent trolls emerge?
	- does classifying docs by desc tell us anything?
	- Most litigious parties
	- what are the most litigious years (though by the literature, it seems like 2000 - Present are the most because of software patents)
	- Possible to identify patents?
	- Is there a graph to be had anywhere?
	- Text processing?

- Trademarks:
	- Types of trademarks over time
	- Really look at the event table for trends
	- Events and owners
	- Is there a graph to be had anywhere?
	- Again, Text processing.
